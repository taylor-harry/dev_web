1. Create your Facebook Business Page

   Head to facebook.com/pages/create. You need to be logged into a Facebook personal account to get started, but your personal information will not appear on your new business page.
   Choose your page type: Business/brand or Community/public figure
   Enter your business details.

2) Add brand images

   Upload your profile and cover photos. Make sure to use the optimum image sizes for Facebook so they look their best.

3. Complete your Page info

   Click Edit Page Info and fill in the following sections:

   Description: 255 characters to describe who you are and what you do.
   Contact information: Fill in all the ways you want people to be able to reach you (including your website).
   Extra options: If it’s relevant to your business, add your operating hours, price range, and privacy policy.

4) Create your Facebook username (aka your vanity URL)

   Your username helps people find you on Facebook. Click Create Page @Username to make one. It can be up to 50 characters long.

   Facebook marketing ideas for your vanity URL:

   Choose a search-friendly Page name. In most cases, this will be your brand name.
   If possible, use a consistent username across social networks.

5) Add a call-to-action button

   A call-to-action button gives people a quick and easy way to reach out to you, shop for your products, or otherwise engage with your business. Click Add a Button under your cover photo to set one up.

6) Review your Facebook Page settings

   Your Facebook Page settings give you custom control over who sees what on your page. Take a look to make sure you understand the privacy and security settings in particular.

That’s it! Your Facebook Page is set up and ready to go.
