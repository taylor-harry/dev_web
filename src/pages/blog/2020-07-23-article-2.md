1. Create your new Facebook Business Page

   Head to facebook.com/pages/create. You need to be logged into a Facebook personal account to get started, but your personal information will not appear on your new business page.
   Choose your page type: Business/brand or Community/public figure
   Enter your business details.

2) Add your brand images

   Upload your profile and cover photos. Make sure to use the optimum image sizes for Facebook so they look their best.

3. Complete your Page information

   Click Edit Page Info and fill in the following sections:

   Description: Add a description on who you are and what you do.
   Contact information: The ways you want people to be able to reach you.
   Extra options: If itâ€™s relevant to your business, add your operating hours, price range, and privacy policy.

4) Create your Facebook username for your business

   Your username helps people find you on Facebook. Click Create Page @Username to make one. It can be up to 50 characters long.

   Facebook marketing ideas for your vanity URL:

   Choose a search-friendly Page name. In most cases, this will be your brand name.
   Use a consistent username across social media networks.

5) Make sure to add a call-to-action button

   A call-to-action button gives people a way to reach out to you or otherwise engage with your business. Click Add a Button under your cover photo to set one up.

6) Review the Facebook Page settings

   Your settings give you control over who sees what on your page. Make sure you understand the privacy and security settings in particular.

All Done! YourPage is set up and ready to bring in those customers.
